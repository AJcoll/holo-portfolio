Interactive Holographic HUD Portfolio
An interactive, holographic HUD-themed portfolio showcasing my skills in UX Design, Development, and IT/Cybersecurity.

This project is a custom-built personal portfolio designed to be a memorable and engaging experience, moving beyond the standard webpage format. It presents my work and skills through the metaphor of a futuristic Heads-Up Display (HUD) or a personal operating system.
